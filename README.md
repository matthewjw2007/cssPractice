# cssPractice
This is a simple practice exercise that shows how to use some of the different selectors CSS has to offer. In order to see
how the selectors work, you can download the .html and .css file to your local computer. Make sure to have them both in the
same folder and open the .html file with any web browser of your choosing. You will see all of the css that was applied to the
html.
